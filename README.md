# express-routescan

This module is an automatic javascript files scanner for Express JS router.

# Installation	
```
$ npm install express-routescan
```

# Usage
Express-routescan module is the simplest way to configure and maintain router for complex express applications. You just have to create a 'routes' folder (default) inside your project and write your routes.

So app structure will be like this:

- app.js
- routes/
	- index.js
	- users.js
	- transaction/
		- submit.js

For correct working you should pass express application into the module as first argument. Example:

```javascript
// requires
var express = require('express');
var routescan = require('express-routescan');
// â€¦
	
var app = express();

// app configuration
	
// start express-routescan. 
routescan(app);

// ...
```

If you want to use another folder for routes, you should use the full path:

```javascript
var fullPath = path.join(__dirname, './path/for/another/routes/folder/insideMyProject');
routescan(app, fullPath);
```

# Route files
In turn, the route file is a file with module.exports like this:

```javascript
/* GET home page. */

var indexFn = function(req, res){
	res.send("It's main page of my app.");
};

module.exports = {
	route: '/',
	callback: indexFn
};
```

_'route'_ and _'callback'_ keys **are required**. Express-routescan ignore invalid routes.

**GET** is default method for route. But you can set optional another _'method'_ (one of HTTP methods described in RFC 2616) and _'middleware'_ function(s):

```javascript
module.exports = {
	method: 'post',
	route: '/myAwesomeRouteForPostRequest',
	middleware: [myMiddlewareFn1, myMiddlewareFn2],
 	callback: function(req, res){
		res.send("It's my awesome answer for POST request.");
	};
};
```

# .routeignore
As was mentioned above express-routescan ignore invalid route-files. Scanner also ignore all _not .js_ files inside routes folder. If you want to ignore _.js_ files you can use _.routeignore_ file inside your routes folder to add ignore rules for scanner.

For example, if you don't want use routes from _'./routes/temp/'_ folder just create _'./routes/.routeignore'_ file with next content:

```
temp/
```
