# express-routescan

This module is an automatic javascript files scanner for Express JS router.

## Installation	
```
$ npm install express-routescan
```

## Usage
Express-routescan module is the simplest way to configure and maintain router for complex express applications. You just have to create a 'routes' folder (default) inside your project and write your routes.

So app structure will be like this:

- app.js
- routes/
	- index.js
	- users.js
	- transaction/
		- submit.js

For correct working you should pass express application into the module as first argument. Example:

```javascript
// requires
var express = require('express');
var routescan = require('express-routescan');
// â€¦
	
var app = express();

// app configuration
	
// start express-routescan. 
routescan(app);

// ...
```

###Options

###### Another directory

If you want to use another folder for routes, you should use the full path:

```javascript
routescan(app, {
	directory: path.join(__dirname, './path/for/another/routes/folder/insideMyProject')
});
```

###### Extentions

## Route files
#### Simple example
In turn, the simplest route file is a file with module.exports like this:

```javascript
/* GET home page. */

module.exports = {
	'/': function(req, res){
		res.send("It's main page of my app.");
	}
};
```

Express-routescan ignore invalid routes by default.

#### Complex example
['get'] is default methods array for route. But you can set optional another _'methods'_ (array of HTTP methods described in RFC 2616) and _'middleware'_ function(s):

```javascript
module.exports = {
	'/myAwesomeRouteForGetAndPost': {
		methods: ['get', 'post'],
		middleware: [myMiddlewareFnOne, myMiddlewareFnTwo],
	 	callback: function(req, res){
			res.send("It's my awesome answer for GET and POST requests.");
		}
	},
	'/myAnotherAwesomeRouteForPostRequest': {
		methods: ['post'],
		middleware: [myMiddlewareFnTwo],
	 	callback: function(req, res){
			res.send("It's my another awesome answer only for POST request.");
		}
	}
};
```

#### RegExp usage example
Next example shows how you can use regexp with express-routescan.

```javascript
module.exports = {
	'/commits': {
		regexp: /^\/commits\/(\w+)(?:\.\.(\w+))?$/,
		callback: function(req, res){
			res.send("It's page would match \"GET /commits/71dbb9c\" as well as \"GET /commits/71dbb9c..4c084f9\".");
		}
	}
};
```


## .routeignore
As was mentioned above express-routescan ignore invalid route-files. Scanner also ignore all _not .js_ files inside routes folder. If you want to ignore _.js_ files you can use _.routeignore_ file inside your routes folder to add ignore rules for scanner.

For example, if you don't want use routes from _'./routes/temp/'_ folder just create _'./routes/.routeignore'_ file with next content:

```
temp/
```
